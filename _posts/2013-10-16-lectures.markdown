  This post is work in progress. To see only finished posts, please refer to

  Over the last couple of weeks I've realized that it could be interesting to
try to run an equivalent of Math and Computer Science Club of Riga in Zagreb.

  So this post is dedicated for some lecture/talk ideas along with short
descriptions/lecture plans.
